                    Users are interested in learning more about plants they encounter in nature. It is difficult to look
                    up information about plants by their features. Our solution should provide users with a way to
                    easily identify plants by their characteristics and determine whether or not they are safe to touch,
                    eat, etc.

                    My group and I brainstormed ideas for our Plant Finder app, including ideas for our plant database, social features, user features, and accessibility.
